# angles-from-flex
This code will display the bend angle and resistance from flex sensor

Firstly the voltage measured from the arduino board is taken. Then the resistance of the flex at 0 and 90 degrees is taken using a multi-meter

The code will formulate the ADC values from the sensor and gives the output resistance and angles.

This project was executed on Arduino and the constant values might differ for different sensors and boards.
